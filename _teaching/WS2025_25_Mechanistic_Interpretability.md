Kick-off: 20.10.2025

ECTS: 8 for MSc students, 12 for BSc students 

A well meaning tip: Please expect this course to be about as much work as a BSc Thesis (compare to ECTS). Speaking from experience of the last few iterations of this course, doiing a software project half-heartedly is not a fun experience. If this sounds like too much work because of other responsibilites, it probably is. However, also speaking from experience, motivated students can learn a LOT in this course, and some even came out with publications. I personally do not care about the level of experience you come in with, as long as you are willing to put in the work and are eager to learn.

Resources: There are a lot of great minds actively doing research in the area of mechanistic interpretability, who have developed and collected great resources. If you are particularly keen, these are good starting points. 

<h2>Course Content</h2>
This course will consists of two parts: 

In the first part, we will focus on understanding and using the most important methods of mechanisitic interpretability (MI) research. Every week will be dedicated to a method, with a mini-lecture, a hands on part, and a small homework. 

In the second part, students will independently work on a small MI project, with weekly optional office hours.
